<h4> Purpose of the boot camp: </h4>

We have different test suite maintained in our project and we write different types of the test. The general observation is, the coding principles/fundamentals we follow in our production code, we don't observe them in functional tests! These test lack things like proper structuring of code and this makes test suite become rigid, fragile, immobile and  



Why Object boot camp?

We write different types of test. And in general many times, end to end testing is under QA bucket! Unlike developers, QA write automation code and you can see so many (anti-pattern)[http://martinfowler.com/bliki/AntiPattern.html] in the test code written by QA.

- You will random creation of modules / classes.
- Sooner, you will see lot of inheritance all around the code. As if, inheritance is the way to solve any problem!
- There will be big functions and if-else ladder and you will wonder what it is doing?
- There will be , ...  and the list is so long!

My code works! Is it good code, right?
- Yes, we need to have that.
- Debugging becomes hell of difficult!
- If anything goes wrong, people tend to think the easiest fix is increase timeout here and there!
- Whenever there is change, you need to update so many things! and you are lucky if it works at very fist time! (That means you remember you have to change at 100 places! )

What is missing?
- Proper coding practices.
- Clean code

and hence this bootcamp! Perhaps everyone's definition of clean code is different!
