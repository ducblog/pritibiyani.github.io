What can be title?

 - Treat your test code as production code!
 - Test code is architecture, unlike a production code!
 - Test design patterns, do they exists?
 -


 How can I strucutre this?

 - Like a conversation style, uncle bob has done for structured programming!
 - Start can be set as a conversation style!

Structure

 - Start
 - Conversation. To set why we need to have a good code in a function automation suite.
 - Then, what are the problem with bad code? We want to get things done! Re-writing of a code!
 - There is problem with every code, which is writeen very fast and not think through!

Problems:

  - Money + Shape
  - Pastie  complete the problem (can use strategy pattern )
  - One example for web automation  How we can tie different patterns to problem.


What is take away?

 - Writing good code is very important, be it whatever!
 - Clean code is the key!
 - 9 principle you can start using it!
 - Use SOLID principles.
 - Make example of each and try to utilize that. 

<h4> Purpose of the boot camp: </h4>

We have different test suite maintained in our project and we write different types of the test. The general observation is, the coding principles/fundamentals we follow in our production code, we don't observe them in functional tests! These test lack things like proper structuring of code and this makes test suite becomes:

 - Rigid

    Single change leads to series of changes in subsequent layers and those layers are unknown sometimes!

 - Fragile

    When we make changes at place 'A', it leads to cause in failure for 'X', where 'A' and 'X' are not related to each other. Because of breaking other unknown things, team members tend to overlook the failure and hesitate to make any changes.

 - Immobile

    It becomes impossible to reuse the things. To extract out reusable part becomes pain and utterly impossible, hence we end up in re-writing new design, rather than using existing one!

Why this happen?
- We don't think, we just implement!

- My code is working, CI is green, all OK, right?

- 

What are the reasons behind this


Why Object boot camp?

We write different types of test. And in general many times, end to end testing is under QA bucket! Unlike developers, QA write automation code and you can see so many (anti-pattern)[http://martinfowler.com/bliki/AntiPattern.html] in the test code written by QA.

- You will random creation of modules / classes.
- Sooner, you will see lot of inheritance all around the code. As if, inheritance is the way to solve any problem!
- There will be big functions and if-else ladder and you will wonder what it is doing?
- There will be , ...  and the list is so long!

My code works! Is it good code, right?
- Yes, we need to have that.
- Debugging becomes hell of difficult!
- If anything goes wrong, people tend to think the easiest fix is increase timeout here and there!
- Whenever there is change, you need to update so many things! and you are lucky if it works at very fist time! (That means you remember you have to change at 100 places! )

What is missing?
- Proper coding practices.
- Clean code

and hence this bootcamp! Perhaps everyone's definition of clean code is different!
